# SpaceShooter
This is the third-person shooter game as instructed by [the Unity tutorial]
[tutorial] video series.

The player is a space ship which can shoot incoming asteroids. It is a simple
game which repeats endlessly until an asteroid collides with the player.

The main goal of this tutorial is to provide an example of how to incorporate
pre-built assets, both graphical and aural, into a Unity project. It is common
practice for Unity developers to work with provided assets.
